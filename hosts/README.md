# Hosts

This is a description of the machines I manage with NixOS.
All machines are named as a Greek letter.
The letter itself has no meaning in relation to machine function.
Its is an arbitrary choice when I configure a new machine.

## [Alpha]

My daily driver laptop.
Currently a Lenevo T560.

## Sigma

Temporary host running various services. Will be replaced with a new system in
the near future.

## Tau

VM running under HyperV on my main desktop. Main purpose is a build server
since its got lots of RAM of spare CPU cycles.
