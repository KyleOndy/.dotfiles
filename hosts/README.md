# Hosts

This is a description of the machines I manage with NixOS.
All machines are named as a Greek letter.
The letter itself has no meaning in relation to machine function.
Its is an arbitrary choice when I configure a new machine.

## Alpha

My daily driver laptop.
Currently a Lenevo T560.

## Beta

KVM guest running under one of my Unraid systems.
Nothing special about this machine.
The plan is to use this as a build host as it has access to more powerful hardware.

## Zeta

VMware workstation guest used at work.
