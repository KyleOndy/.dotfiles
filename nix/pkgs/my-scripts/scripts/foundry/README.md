# Foundry

Mainly used to manage my day-to-day at ${WORK}. This is not intended to be
reusable, I write and maintain this functionality for myself. Feel free to take
what you from this.

## functionality

### Logs

My main use of `foundry` is to make ad-hoc notes throughout the day, and almost
more importantly, give me the tools and a framework for reviewing and
propagating these notes over the period of weeks, quarters, and years.

### Work tracking

Foundry can open a new `tmux` window setup for a specific ticket.
